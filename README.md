# EinsteinFieldEquations
This program will compute some key ingredients of standard general relativity.
This code is straightforward, you only need to input coordinates and then then metric tensor in input section and the code print
1 - Metric Tensor
2 - Inverse Metric Tensor
3 - Christoffel symbols ( Second kind )
4 - Riemann curvature tensor 
5 - Ricci tensor
6 - Scalar curvature
7 - Einstein Field Equations
for you.
